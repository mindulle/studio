# Storage

Storage refers to how, where, how much, and how long encoded information is retained within the memory system.

Encoded information is first stored in short-term memory(STM) and then, if need be, is stored in long-term memory(LTM)

![The differences between STM and LTM. (Adapted from: Roediger & McDermott, 1995)](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/sites/projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/styles/os_files_xxlarge/public/shadowbok/files/stm-ltm.png?m=1516041147&itok=bySmBXen)

## Short Term Memory(STM)

- Primarily encoded acoustically
- 15-30 Seconds Long
- Limited Storage (5 - 9 items)

## Logn Term Memory(LTM)

- Primarily encoded semantically
- indefinite duration of storage
- unlimited storage
