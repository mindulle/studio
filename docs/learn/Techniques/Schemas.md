# Schemas

Schemas refer to the mental frameworks an individual creates to help them understand and organize new information.

Schemas act as a cognitive “shortcut” in that they allow individuals to interpret new information quicker than when not using schemas.

:::warning
However, schemas may also prevent individuals from learning pertinent information that falls outside the scope of the schema that has been created.
