# Stochastic

Stochastic decision making, or random chance, works well for low-stakes decisions when options are well-defined and all possible outcomes appear equal.

## Condition

- [x] Narrow Impact
- [x] Uncertain Outcomes
- [x] Concentrated Expertise (you)
- [x] Low Risk

### Flip a coin

Taken from game theory, a stochastic solution is one where you choose randomly from a variety of comparable options. The process can be as private as a coin-flip or as public as a roulette wheel; the point is not to waste time doing deep dives when any of the options appear to work equally well.

### Pro

Fast and potentially fun

### Con

Dangerous unless options are well-vetted for equivalent outcomes

### The Process

1. Gather your options
2. Vet them to make sure they are well-defined and comparable
3. Add them to a randomization method (e.g. coin flip or wheel)
4. Play! (er, decide)

### Avoid These Common Traps

#### Falling prey to the either/or fallacy

The either/or fallacy is a cognitive bias whereby we think in only absolutes and frame every decision as only two possibilities. When making a random choice, don't skip brainstorming options with your group.

#### Rejecting the process after not getting what you want

It's especially easy to question making a random choice when you don't like the outcome. Be sure to agree as a group, before deciding, that you'll commit to the final decision whatever it may be.

### Alternative Models

If you absolutely can't live with the way your stochastic cookie crumbled, you can take it back and decide [autocratically](./autocratic).

Or if a single group member is especially troubled by the result and has unique expertise or insight, consider [delegating](./delegation) the decision.
